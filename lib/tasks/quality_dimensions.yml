          question: "1a.1 Was the allocation sequence random?"
          description: "Yes, if a random component was used in the sequence generation process such as using a computer generated random numbers, referring to a random number table, minimization, coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; or drawing of lots. Minimization may be implemented without a random element, and this is considered to be equivalent to being random. No, if the sequence is non-random, such that it is either likely to introduce confounding, or is predictable or difficult to conceal, e.g. alternation, methods based on dates (of birth or admission) or patient record numbers, allocation decision made by clinicians or participants, based on the availability of the intervention, or any other systematic or haphazard method. If the only information about randomization methods is to state that the study is randomized, then this signalling question should generally be answered as “No information”. There may be situations in which a judgement is made to answer Probably No or Probably Yes. For example, if the study was large, conducted by an independent trials unit or carried out for regulatory purposes, then it may be reasonable to assume that the sequence was random. Alternatively, if other (contemporary) trials by the same investigator team have clearly used non-random sequences, it might be reasonable to assume that the current study was done using similar methods. Similarly, if participants and personnel are all unaware of intervention assignments throughout/during the trial (blinding or masking), this may be an indicator that the allocation process was also concealed, but this will not necessarily always be the case. If the allocation sequence was clearly concealed but there is no information about how the sequence was generated, it will often be reasonable to assume that the sequence was random (although this will not necessarily always be the case)."

It is important first to consider carefully whether there are any ways in which the allocation could potentially have been subverted (deliberately tampered with so that clusters end up in a group they were not supposed to be randomized to if the randomization was conducted properly). This will usually include a consideration of whether any individuals were aware of any potential allocations prior to those allocations being made. However, although subversion may be possible, it is often the case that in cluster randomized trials those who could subvert the randomization have less motivation and/or knowledge to do so (see text for further explanation), so a judgement must be made as to whether this is likely."

          question: "1a.3 Were there baseline imbalances that suggest a problem with the randomization process?"
          description: "Imbalances in numbers of clusters or stratification factors or other cluster characteristics are usually the best evidence of problems with the randomization process, but such problems are relatively unusual as explained in 1a.2. On the other hand, due to the small numbers of clusters randomized in most cluster randomized trials, chance imbalances in either cluster or participant characteristics are more common than in individually-randomized trials and can sometimes appear substantial. As for the tool for individually-randomized trials, chance imbalances should not be highlighted here, and neither should imbalances that are due to identification/recruitment bias (which are assessed in Domain 1b). Answer No if no imbalances are apparent or if any observed imbalances are compatible with chance Answer Yes only if there is clear evidence of imbalances that appear to be due to problems with randomization. In some circumstances, it may be reasonable to answer Yes/Probably yes (rather than, No information) when there is a surprising lack of information on baseline characteristics when such information could reasonably be expected to be available/reported. If there is no information about cluster characteristics record, No information. The answer to this question should not be used to influence answers to questions 1a.1 or 1a.2. For example, if the trial has large baseline imbalances, but authors report adequate randomization methods, questions 1a.1 and 1a.2 should still be answered on the basis of the reported adequate methods, and any concerns about the imbalance should be raised in the answer to the question 1a.3 and reflected in the domain-level risk of bias judgement)."

          question: "2.3 If Y/PY/NI to 2.1 or 2.2: Were there deviations from the intended intervention beyond what would be expected in usual practice?"
          description: "When interest focusses on the effect of assignment to intervention, it is important to distinguish between: (a) deviations that happen in usual practice following the intervention and so are part of the intended intervention (for example, cessation of an exercise programme for health related issues); and (b) deviations from intended intervention that arise due to expectations of a difference between intervention and comparator (for example because participants feel ‘unlucky’ to have been assigned to the comparator group and therefore seek the active intervention, or components of it, or other interventions). We use the term “usual practice” to refer to the usual course of events in a non-trial context. Because deviations that arise due to expectations of a difference between intervention and comparator are not part of usual practice, they may lead to biased effect estimates that do not reflect what would happen to participants assigned to the interventions in practice. Deviations from the intended intervention that arise due to expectations of a difference between intervention and comparator are rarely reported in cluster randomized trials and may, in fact, occur rarely. This is likely to be partly because it is very often the case in these trials that those who might have the opportunity to introduce deviations will not have any inclination to deliberately affect the results of the trial by doing so. In addition the more complex the intervention, the more difficult it might be to practically identify such deviations. The answer “No information” will therefore be appropriate in many cases, but “Probably yes” should be used if it seems likely that such deviations occurred."

Note that imputed data should be regarded as missing data, and not considered as “outcome data” in the context of this question. Nearly All, (equivalently, a low or modest amount of missing data) should be interpreted as “enough to be confident of the findings”, and a suitable proportion depends on the context. For continuous outcomes, availability of data from 95% (or possibly 90%) of the participants would often be sufficient. For dichotomous outcomes, the proportion required is directly linked to the risk of the event. If the observed number of events is much greater than the number of participants with missing outcome data, the bias would necessarily be small."

For example, the domain pain may be measured using multiple scales (e.g. a visual analogue scale and the McGill Pain Questionnaire), each at multiple time points (e.g. 3, 6 and 12 weeks post-treatment). If multiple measurements were made, but only one or a subset is reported on the basis of the results (e.g. statistical significance), there is a high risk of bias in the fully reported result. A response of Yes/Probably yes is reasonable if: There is clear evidence (usually through examination of a trial protocol or statistical analysis plan) that a domain was measured in multiple ways, but data for only one or a subset of measures is fully reported (without justification), and the fully reported result is likely to have been selected on the basis of the results. Selection on the basis of the results arises from a desire for findings to be newsworthy, sufficiently noteworthy to merit publication, or to confirm a prior hypothesis. For example, trialists who have a preconception or vested interest in showing that an experimental intervention is beneficial may be inclined to selectively report outcome measurements that are favourable to the experimental intervention. A response of No/Probably no is reasonable if: There is clear evidence (usually through examination of a trial protocol or statistical analysis plan) that all reported results for the outcome domain correspond to all intended outcome measurements or there is only one possible way in which the outcome domain can be measured (hence there is no opportunity to select from multiple measures) or outcome measurements are inconsistent across different reports on the same trial, but the trialists have provided the reason for the inconsistency and it is not related to the nature of the results.

          description: "Evidence for robustness may come from how missing data were handled in the analysis and whether sensitivity analyses were performed by the investigators, or occasionally from additional analyses performed by the systematic reviewers. It is important to assess whether assumptions employed in analyses are clear and plausible. Both content knowledge and statistical expertise will often be required for this.  For instance, use of a statistical method such as multiple imputation does not guarantee an appropriate answer. Review authors should seek naïve (complete-case) analyses for comparison, and clear differences between complete-case and multiple imputation-based findings should lead to careful assessment of the validity of the methods used.

The balance between the benefit(s) and harm(s) of an intervention (i.e. drug or surgery) is ideally used to determine its efficacy or effectiveness. Pre-defined indicates that the harms that were expected are explicitly defined prior to the collection of these expected events. For example, if bleeding is listed as a harmful event, the criteria by which they determine the bleeding (i.e. body location, type, or amount of blood loss that counts as an event, etc) should be specified. Standardized classification of harms can be derived from any of the following: 1) reference to standard terminology or classifications of harms from a recognized external organization(s)(such as government regulatory or health agencies. Examples of standardized terminology for harms includes, WHO-ART, MEDra, HTA report on the Measurement and Monitoring of Surgical Adverse Events); 2) previously explicitly defined classifications of harms in the literature, or; 3) based on pre-specified clinical criteria, or; 4) pre-specified laboratory test (may not need to have a specific cut-off level specified in all cases).

          description: "Relative to the original number of subjects that were enrolled in the study, not all participants will complete the study for one of the following reasons: 1) Withdrawal indicates that the participants did not complete the treatment due to a variety of reasons such as they could not tolerate the treatment due to experiencing harmful events, or they were unable to comply with the treatment: a) Some studies will not specify the reasons for participants withdrawal but will indicate the total number; b) Some studies will specify the total number of withdrawals and the numbers for each specific reason that participants withdrew from the study. Although the means by which author(s) attribute the reasons for withdrawal may not always be reproducible or free of bias, it is important that the total numbers of withdrawals are specified. 2) Loss to follow-up indicates participants that cannot be traced or contacted to determine important endpoints. We require that the study specify the numbers for both of these reasons to meet the intent of this quality item."

For example, how events may have been categorized, or how recurrent events were tabulated, or timing issues (repeated measures), or any statistical techniques in the analysis. Statistical analyses can include a variety of approaches. Typically, descriptive presentation of the harms events is shown and a comparison between groups (for example with a Fischers Exact Test, students t-test) is undertaken. More sophisticated analyses can include multivariate analyses (for example regression and survival analysis) that attempt to evaluate which factors predict the harms. This type of analysis is seen typically when the outcome of harm is one of the primary study outcomes. Often variables that have the potential to influence the occurrence of harms can be evaluated with covariate analysis. For example, covariates such as age and gender can be evaluated in such an analysis to detect their potential to act as confounders for the harms."

There is a high risk of bias if participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; or other explicitly unconcealed procedures."

Note: these percentages are commonly used but arbitrary, not supported by the literature). For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate. For continuous outcome data, the plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing data were imputed using appropriate methods.
