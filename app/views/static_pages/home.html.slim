    h2 Welcome to the <i>Systematic Review Data Repository</i> &trade;
    p.hide-for-medium style='margin-top: 0;' The Systematic Review Data Repository (SRDR) is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for
      the extraction and management of data for systematic review or meta-analysis. It is
      also an open and searchable archive of systematic reviews and its corresponding data.
    p.hide-for-small-only style='margin-top: 0;' Systematic Review Data Repository. SRDR is the world&#39;s first open-access repository for
      sharing of data abstracted from primary studies used in systematic reviews. It is also an online
      collaborative tool to assist researchers in collecting these information. It was developed by
      researchers at Brown EPC in recognition of the need to modernize systematic review. The SRDR
      website went live in June 2012. SRDR allows users to prospectively enter data using data entry forms
      or retrospectively upload data files in a variety of formats. Prospective structured data entry is much
      preferred as the data can be easily searched and manipulated, and less processing will be required
      by users. SRDR provides a rich repertoire of tools to assist users with creatinge data entry forms that
      can capture any kind of clinical study information that are likely encountered in systematic reviews.
      The data needs for evidence mapping is much simpler and can be handled with data entry forms
      currently implemented in SRDR. SRDR also incorporates tools has facilities to export data that was
      entered in a structured format.
      SRDR was developed on the Ruby on Rails platform and with flexibility and expansion in mind.
      The Rails platform was chosen as the underlying SRDR software development and deployment
      platform because it offered a number of desirable attributes that addressed many of the requirements
      for building a secure, extensible, robust, and highly maintainable database driven web-based
      application such as the SRDR. Ruby on Rails is also known as a “rapid development” platform, which
      allows a small software development team to quickly implement and deploy a rich user experience
      web-application. The rapid development nature of Ruby on Rails also makes the platform easy to
      maintain and extend as users’ needs evolve over time.
      SRDR currently has over 1500 registered project contributors from over 140 countries. As of
      November 2015, data from 5595 studies in 48 systematic review projects have been published in
      SRDR, most of the published projects are AHRQ funded EPC comparative effectiveness reviews. In
      addition, data from over 40,000 studies in over 300 projects have been entered but not yet published.
      While SRDR was initially developed to serve data collection and repository functions, it has also been
      used by instructors to teach systematic review courses. 5,6 We have partnered with collaborators to
      expand the capabilities and user base of SRDR. For example, we are collaborating with Tianjing Li,
      MD, PhD at Johns Hopkins in a PCORI funded project to develop a data abstraction assistant for
      systematic review that capitalizes on SRDR&#39;s infrastructure and to evaluate this tool in a randomized
      trial. We are also collaborating with a research group at University of Maryland and constructed a
      complementary and alternative medicine clinical trial registry that was funded by a grant from the
      National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2R24AT001293-10).
      We are aware of two other systematic review data repositories. One is owned by a commercial
      vendor (Doctor Evidence, LLC) and the other by the non-profit Cochrane Collaboration. These are
      proprietary systems and the data and the tools are not open to the public. SRDR team is collaborating
      with both organizations in an effort to promote data sharing and standardization of the data collection.

        | The objectives of this database are to: 1. Systematically compile
          and provide access to primary, English-language, peer-reviewed
          science linking dietary fiber intake in humans to one or more of 9
          potential health benefits 2. Provide researchers with a tool to
          understand how different fibers are characterized in studies 3.
          Facilitate researchers in identifying gaps in the current research
          4. Create a database to serve as a starting foundation of primary
          human literature for conducting evidence-based reviews and
          meta-analyses 5. Efficiently assist researchers in identifying
          fibers of interest This database should serve as a foundation for
          future work. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, detailed in
          the user manual, were applied in determining database eligibility;
          thus, this database is not intended to serve as a sole source for
          identifying all possible fiber literature for the purposes of
          conducting a meta-analysis or systematic review. This database
          contains Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO)
          data to help users formulate and narrow the focus of their research
          question. It is expected that secondary searches will be conducted
          to augment this database.
